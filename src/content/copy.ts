# Reflection — *Global Tuition, Local Austerity*

## Topic & why I chose it
Public universities say they value global diversity—but the budget math often tells another story. I kept hearing that international and out-of-state tuition "keeps the lights on," while friends (international and domestic) wondered who higher ed really serves. That tension—between *mission* and *money*—is why I chose to explore how reliance on international fees props up public universities, and what it means for youth who are studying, organizing, and imagining their futures on these campuses.

## My position
I argue that U.S. public universities have slid into a **high-tuition/high-aid** equilibrium that leans on nonresident and international students as revenue sources. This stabilizes budgets in the short run but **commodifies** some students, **distorts** admissions incentives, and can **widen inequities** for marginalized domestic students. Public funding should be the backbone of public universities; when it isn't, "diversity" risks being used as a marketing veneer for austerity finance.

## What I found (and how course ideas reframed it)
**1) Disinvestment ↔ recruitment.** A core empirical finding is the link between state disinvestment and international enrollment. When public research universities face cuts, they enroll more full-paying foreign undergraduates—a clear substitution toward tuition revenue.

**2) The money is large and systemic.** International students contributed **$43.8 billion** to the U.S. economy and supported **~378,000 jobs** in 2023–24—numbers that underscore how much universities and local communities now depend on them. Even with a modest recovery in FY2024 state appropriations, growth barely outpaced inflation, which explains why the tuition model persists.

**3) Who gets a seat?** Flagship universities have **raised the share of out-of-state students** markedly over the last two decades, reflecting both market pressure and price incentives. That shift can squeeze local access and change campus demographics in ways that track revenue rather than need.

**4) Lived positioning matters.** Critiques caution against framing internationals as **"cash cows."** Scholars argue this marketised stance dehumanizes students and can excuse under-investment in their support; others show how, especially for Asian students during COVID-19, bodies were simultaneously securitized and monetized—*peril* and *profit* at once.

**How the course shifted my lens.**  
- **Eve Tuck (2009)** warns against *damage-centered* stories. That pushed me to avoid portraying international students only as victims or ATMs.  
- **Golash-Boza (2016)** links race, migration, and capitalism; **racial capitalism** clarifies why price tiers and pipelines map onto global inequalities.  
- **kihana miraya ross (2020)** distinguishes **anti-Blackness** from generic racism—who loses supports under austerity?

## Other sides (and my response)
- **Pro:** Differential pricing cross-subsidizes in-state students, funds labs, and keeps programs alive when legislatures won't.  
  *Response:* Short-term solvency can't justify **structural over-pricing** or using "diversity" as fiscal camouflage. A public mission should be financed publicly.
- **Con:** Just cap nonresident enrollment and cut spending.  
  *Response:* Cuts alone don't reverse disinvestment. Durable fixes require **restored public funding**, transparent budgeting, and genuine inclusion.

## Why this matters for youth
For international students, belonging frays when you're welcomed for tuition but not fully supported. For domestic youth—especially Black and low-income students—**austerity shifts risk** onto those already facing barriers. Treating education as a **market** first and a **public good** second narrows the democratic promise of higher ed.

## What I'll do
I plan to share this site with student government and the international student association, asking for three steps: (1) publish a plain-language budget explainer showing where nonresident tuition goes, (2) commit a slice of nonresident revenue to **need-based supports**, and (3) lobby the state for multi-year funding compacts so tuition isn't the default patch.
